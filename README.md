# Predicting-H1N1-and-Seasonal-Flu-Vaccination-Uptake-Using-Machine-Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether an individual received a H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccine using demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based survey data. The project is part of my fulfillment of course expectations for my Moringa School Phase 3 Data Science Course.
